## Project Context Summary (as of v0.1-beta)

### Current Project Status (Phase 1 Complete)

Your "OFFSET GARAGE" project is currently in the following state:

*   **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    *   **Main Page:** Displays various artwork thumbnail boxes in a Broken Grid layout.
        *   **Drag Functionality:** Boxes can be freely dragged without affecting other boxes. (Collision push logic has been removed as per user request.)
        *   **Initial Placement:** On page load, boxes are placed without overlapping by more than 50px.
        *   **Checklist Box:** The black fill of the checkbox button is precisely centered within the white border box, and no ghosting occurs during dragging.
    *   **Inkdrop (Guestbook) Page:** Displays guestbook entries with a similar design tone to the main page.
        *   Guestbook entries are also initially placed without overlap and can be freely dragged.
        *   Provides a fixed text input field at the bottom (max 100 characters) with real-time character count and automatic input field height adjustment.
        *   IP-based 3-post-per-day limit is simulated on the frontend.
    *   **Theme Switching:** Light/Dark/System mode switching functions correctly.
    *   **About Page:** Displays creator information as an overlay.
    *   **Version Indicator:** Displays website version information, future roadmap, and update history.
    *   **UI/UX Guidelines:** Adheres to defined UI/UX guidelines including button heights, font sizes, colors, and `border-radius: 0px`.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   The website has been successfully deployed to `leehansol.world` custom domain via Netlify. It benefits from Netlify's fast CDN and automatic HTTPS.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   The project is managed with Git, and the current state is tagged as `v0.1-beta`.

### Completed Tasks

*   **Verify CSS Fixes for UI** (ID: `908a4d7d-f543-416c-a9f8-9fc5641f5ec5`)
    *   Checkbox alignment and drag ghosting CSS fixes completed.
*   **Refine resolveCollision for Precise Directional Pushes** (ID: `819df1ca-5e7e-4537-b202-234f8fa8318a`)
    *   The `resolveCollision` function in `draggable.js` was refined for precise collision detection and pushing, but this logic was later deactivated (removed) and replaced with free drag as per user request.

### Remaining Tasks (from project_docs.md roadmap)

*   **Integrate and Test Enhanced Collision Logic** (ID: `752ac958-6db8-4ee8-b59d-7cdffd4fbd3b`)
    *   **Current Status:** This task's original goal was to integrate and test enhanced collision logic. However, the user's requirement changed to "free drag except for initial placement." This task can now be considered complete if the current free drag logic meets the user's needs.

### Future Roadmap (from project_docs.md)

1.  **Inkdrop (Guestbook) Backend Integration:**
    *   Currently, the guestbook function is simulated on the frontend. Backend integration is essential for permanently saving and retrieving user-submitted guestbook entries.
    *   **Recommended Solution:** Firebase Firestore (database) + Netlify Functions (serverless backend) combination (operable within free tier).
2.  **Dynamic Artwork Content Management System Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of an artwork content management system based on `ADMIN.md`. This will require a backend database and an administrator interface.
3.  **Enhance Overall Website Accessibility:**
    *   Improve website accessibility to make it usable by a wider range of users.
4.  **Develop Additional Thumbnail Box Templates and Interactions:**
    *   Develop new templates and user interactions for displaying various artworks.
