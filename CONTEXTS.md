- **Working Directory:** /Users/hansol/Documents/06-development/offset-garage
- **Project:** offset-garage - A personal portfolio website.
- **Current Status:** The project has been successfully migrated to a Next.js application. The guestbook functionality, including creating and deleting entries, is fully implemented and working correctly. The draggable artwork functionality is now fully operational. The next major task is to implement a feature for uploading and managing artwork.

- **Migration Progress:**
    - **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript.
    - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is fully configured and operational.
    - **Core Components:** All essential components for the main page, guestbook, and common UI elements are complete.
    - **Pages:** The main page (`/app/page.tsx`) and the guestbook page (`/app/inkdrop/page.tsx`) are fully functional.
    - **Backend (Guestbook):** Supabase is integrated for the guestbook, with API routes for fetching, creating, and deleting entries. The delete functionality is now working as expected after fixing an issue with `revalidatePath`.

- **Completed Tasks (v0.1-final):**
    1.  **Project Setup:** Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
    2.  **Component Migration:** Migrated all static HTML/CSS components to React components.
    3.  **Header/Footer Functionality:** Fixed logo positioning and button functionality.
    4.  **Guestbook Backend:** Implemented a fully functional guestbook with Supabase, including:
        *   Fetching entries (`GET`)
        *   Creating new entries (`POST`)
        *   Deleting entries (`DELETE`) with localhost-only visibility for the delete button.
    5.  **Draggable Artwork:** Implemented smooth, persistent draggable artwork thumbnails with correct click vs. drag behavior.
    6.  **Deployment Fixes:** Resolved various build and deployment issues (TypeScript errors, `_document` errors, incorrect Netlify project linking).
    7.  **7-17-artwork Mobile Optimization Fix:** Addressed a minor bug related to mobile optimization within the `7-17-artwork` folder.

- **Next Steps (v0.2-beta):**
    1.  **Artwork Management Feature:**
        *   Create a separate admin/demo page (`/admin`) for managing content (not for production deployment).
        *   Implement functionality to upload artwork images and associated data (title, description, etc.) to Supabase.
        *   Create an API route (`/api/artwork`) to handle artwork-related operations.
        *   Display the uploaded artwork on the main page (`/app/page.tsx`).
    2.  **Overall UI/UX Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire application to identify and fix any remaining UI/UX inconsistencies or issues.
